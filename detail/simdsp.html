				Distinguishing sequential pattern (DSP) mining, a specific type of contrast data
				mining [1], extracting sequential patterns showing the discrimination between
				two datasets, has attracted considerable attention in many fields. DSP mining
				aims to discover the patterns that occur frequently in one class and infrequently
				in sequences of another class. DSP mining has been proven to be explainable and
				efficient on a two classes comparison [2], such as building accurate classifiers [3],
				detecting anomaly [4] and analyzing biological sequential data [5].

				We want to analyze the purchasing behavior between young customers and senior customers in the shopping transactions, listed in Table 2. In
				our common sense, the products headphone, bluetooth and earphone are similar
				products. If we regard them as the same product, we may get the DSP patterns
				like <span class="bold">< phone, earphone ></span>. We can discover that young customers prefer buying
				the product earphone after purchasing phone compared with senior customers.
				If we match the pattern item by item, we cannot find this phenomenon. Besides, there are many situations in biology that require to consider the similarity
				between items, such as amino acids have similar property in protein.

				we design an efficient algorithm
				to discover simDSPs with follow set which we only need to consider some quality
				candidate patterns rather than enumerate all candidate patterns.

				As stated above, the advantage of candidate-generationand-test approach is high efficiency. However, the memory
				cost is huge, since many temporary results have to be stored.
				Thus, the candidate-generation-and-test approach is unsuitable
				for very large data sets. To overcome this challenges, we
				propose a hybrid search strategy (a combination of breadthfirst search and depth-first search). Specifically, simDSP-Miner
				firstly performs the breadth-first strategy to generate candidate
				patterns using pre-defined amount of memory, then performs
				the depth-first strategy to continue the remaining search.

				SMS spam is an important topic in our life. The dataset of SMS (from <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection" target="_blank">UCI</a>) is different
				from other text sequences because it is messy. In our experiments, we use spam messages as
				positive sequences D+ and ham messages as negative sequences D−. The preprocess of data likes Bible. Something different is that we replace all digit with
				symbol “$” and save the sequences whose length are no less than ten. Table 6
				gives a part of mining results. From the observation in table, there is some difference from the result in Bible experiment because of the messy data of spam
				which has many spelling mistakes. The mining simDSP is interesting. For example, the pattern <span class="bold">< {rply, reply}, { $ } ></span> where the words “rply” and “reply” are
				similar. According to our exprience, they have the same meaning. If we do not
				consider the similarity between them, the pattern <span class="bold">< {rply, reply}, { $ } ></span> cannot
				be discovered. The same situation exists in pattern <span class="bold">< {free, 5free}, {calls, calls1, call} ></span> due to the messy text in spam data, or the trick in spam messages for
				escaping from being filtered by message service.
