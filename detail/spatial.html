				Public bus service plays an indispensable role in modern
				urban traffic system. With the bus running data, the detection of the
				statistically significant aggregations of bus delay is useful for optimizing
				the bus timetable, so that the service quality can be improved. However,
				previous studies have not considered how to detect bus delay aggre
				gation using statistical hypothesis testing. To fill that gap, this paper
				considers the detection of bus delay aggregation from bus running data.
				We present RSTV-Miner, a mining method using statistical hypothesis
				testing, for detecting statistically significant bus delay aggregation. Our
				empirical study on real data demonstrates that RSTV-Miner is effective
				and efficient.

				The city of Tampere, Finland, released as open data [2] the locations
				of its buses at every second. In particular, the bus data includes information on,
				for each bus and each bus stop, whether a bus was on schedule and how much
				was the delay if it was not on time. Table 1 lists several samples of Tampere
				bus data. Each record contains the information of a bus arriving at a bus stop.
				For example, by the first record in Table 1, we can see that a bus of Line 4Y
				arrives at Stop Ammattikoulu (code: 1500, location: 61.49855”N, 23.73550”E)
				at 00:31:31 AM on September 27, 2015 with 60 s behind schedule. As shown in
				the last record in Table 1, the value of “Delay” is minus if the bus arrives ahead
				of schedule, there are also other details not mentioned.

				To detect the aggregation of bus delay, we need to structure an index for
				zones. At this moment, using each zone to structure the index and searching
				for its neighbors is a time-consuming process. In addition, the computation cost
				is very high. This does not allow us to search all sub-areas of S. To address
				this issue, we use R-tree to structure index that will help us to group nearby 
				zones and retrieve data quickly according to their spatial locations. And to be
				more statistical significance, when generating an R-tree, we just use zones which
				overcast at least one bus stop. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, we give an example
				of R-tree structure in which red rectangles represent the zones overcasting bus
				stops. We start to build R-tree by using the zones which have partitioned. As
				illustrate Fig. 1(c), we use R-tree structure, so that a spatial search requires to
				visit only a small number of nodes.

				We present our method, RSVT-Miner, for mining bus delay aggregation from bus dataset. In general, the framework of RSTV-Miner includes: Rtree index structure, spatial-temporal scan, and statistical test. Technically, the
				key issues of RSTV-Miner are generation and effective scan of index. Algorithm 1
				presents the procedure of our method.

				We can find that these zones attached to spatial-temporal area
				are nearby the center square, a bridge, some traffic hubs and narrow places of
				Tampere, as illustrated in Fig. 4 which presents the results from 26th August to
				28th August. These results are in accordance with the previous studies [1] and
				our general knowledge of Tampere traffic.
